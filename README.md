## Prerequisites

* Before running the project ensure you have XAMPP control panel installed
* Enable Apache and MySQL using the XAMPP control panel
* 

## Running the Project
* Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and create a mysql database and name it PreprLabsDemo
* Then run php artisan db:seed from the terminal to seed the database with data
* Run php artisan serve to start the server and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 on your browser
* In order to have google maps correctly change the GOOGLE_API_KEY value GOOGLE_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY

## Technologies Used
* PHP Laravel framework was used to build this application
* Bootstrap was used for the UI 

## Thought Process
* From the given excel sheet of data I interpreted that the colored fields were mandatory to be displayed on the website and the rest were optional
* The first stage of my development process was to figure out how I was going to model the database as I needed to understand how to display the data
  * I came up with the following models: 
    * UserModel Fields: username, password and other fields generated auto generated by the Laravel framework for Authentication
    * LabModel - title, description, image_url, category, location_id, privacy and other fields auto generated by the Laravel framework 
    * LocationModel - country, city, address, latitude, and other fields auto generated by the Laravel framework
* All models use the auto generated id as the primary_key
* For the Images I used unsplash's free API to fetch them randomly. This can be easily changed to have images relevant to the labs.
