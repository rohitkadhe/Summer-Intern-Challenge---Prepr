 * Link to the data provided: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjqJ7kp2AcMQjWaf_exDTTx-1qU4ctGp/view?usp=sharing
 * Purpose: The purpose of this web app is allow students to easily find labs
 * Challenge Duration: March 26th, 2020 - March 29th, 2020

## Prerequisites
* Before running the project ensure you have XAMPP control panel installed
* Enable Apache and MySQL using the XAMPP control panel

## Running The Project
* Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and create a mysql database and name it "preprapp". (This name can be changed in the .env file by changing the DB_DATABASE value) 
* Then run php artisan db:seed from the terminal to seed the database with data
* Run php artisan serve to start the server and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 on your browser
* In order to have google maps work correctly change the GOOGLE_API_KEY value in the .env file to GOOGLE_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY

## Technologies Used
* PHP Laravel framework was used to build this application
* Bootstrap was used for the UI 

## Thought Process
* From the given excel sheet of data I interpreted that the colored fields were mandatory to be displayed on the website and the rest were optional
* The first stage of my development process was to figure out how I was going to model the database as I needed to understand how to display the data
  * I came up with the following models: 
    * UserModel Fields: username, password and other fields generated auto generated by the Laravel framework for Authentication
    * LabModel - title, description, image_url, category, location_id, privacy and other fields auto generated by the Laravel framework 
    * LocationModel - country, city, address, latitude, and other fields auto generated by the Laravel framework
  * All models use the auto generated id as the primary_key
  * For the Images I used unsplash's free API to fetch them randomly (See Demo Video). This can be later changed to have images relevant to the labs
* After creating the models, the next step was to create routes and views to fetch and display the data appropriately. I used bootstrap to create the views

* After having all the data displaying correctly, I wired up authentication into the app using Laravel's build in Auth system. I made changes to get it working with my user model.
  * Primarily overriding a function in the LoginController to have Auth working with 'username' instead of 'email' 
  
* Finally my last step was to integrate with the Google Maps API so that when a User clicks on a Lab's address on the Lab details page a Map opens up with that lab's location pinned and hovering over the pin displays the address. This is how I interpreted the Google Maps portion of the challenge  

## Demo Video Of The App
 * Demo Video is located in 'Project Demo - Video' folder in the root directory of the project
